## Main Concept

This is a basic Mortal Kombat themed fighting game. The game works as follows:
1. User selects a fighter from the available characters at the top of the page.
2. All other fighters are transferred into an opponents section.
3. User selects which opponent they want to face.
4. User clicks attack button, which damages their opponent, but also triggers a counter attack.
    - Stats are listed next to attack button, and HP decreases below user's and opponent's picture. 
    - User's attack power increases by 11 points with each new attack.
5. If user defeats opponent, they select a new opponent.
6. User repeats above steps until all opponents are defeated.

## Technologies Used

For this game, I used standard HTML and CSS for the initial styling and format. My purpose for designing this game was to improve in my understanding of JS logic and functions, as well as to gain experience using the jQuery library. For this reason, the script for this game was written using jQuery.
